# Triple Espresso

Triple Espresso is the 4th project of Triple Ten bootcamp. It displays a static homepage of a non-real coffeeshop. It combines HTML and CSS skills developed throughout the bootcamp.

## Improvements

The reservation service is not active. Likely, it will be coded in the future, when we learn new tecnologies such as javascrip or others.
